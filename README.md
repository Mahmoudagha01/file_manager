# file manager

A new Flutter project I did this app to practice on isolates to achieve multi-thread computing.

## App Features 

1. Home Screen:<br />
a. Display files and folders from the deviceâ€™s root directory.<br />
b. Use a list or grid view to show the contents.<br />
c. Implement navigation to allow users to move through directories
and subdirectories.<br />
3. File & Folder Navigation:<br />
a. Users should be able to click on folders to navigate inside them and
view the files/folders they contain.<br />
b. Implement back navigation to return to previous directories.<br />
4. File and Folder Operations:<br />
a. Users should be able to create new files and folders in any selected
directory.<br />
b. Users should be able to delete files and folders.<br />
c. Users should be able to edit file contents (for text files).<br />
5. Error Handling & User Feedback:<br />
a. Provide proper error messages if a file/folder cannot be created,
deleted, or edited.<br />
b. Ensure the app handles permissions, showing error messages if
access is denied.<br />
6. Sorting & Filtering:<br />
a. Implement sorting (by name, size, date modified).<br />
b. Allow users to filter files based on their type (e.g., images, text files).<br />
7. Form Validation:<br />
a. When creating files/folders, ensure the user provides valid names.<br />
b. Validate file/folder names to prevent duplicates and special
characters that are not allowed.<br />
8. File Details:<br />
a. Provide file details such as size, last modified date, and file type.<br />
